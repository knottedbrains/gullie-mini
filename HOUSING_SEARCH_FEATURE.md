# 🏠 Housing Search Feature - Complete Implementation

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### Backend API (`/api/housing/search`)
- **Location:** `/Users/rachie/gullie-mini/backend/src/services/housingSearch.ts`
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/housing/search`
- **Integration:** APIFY + Zillow via `rigelbytes/zillow-scraper`
- **Supported Cities:** NYC, San Francisco, LA, Seattle, Boston, Chicago, Austin

### Frontend Component
- **Location:** `/Users/rachie/gullie-mini/src/components/HousingSearchActionCard.tsx`
- **Integration:** Appears in housing task cards automatically
- **Features:**
  - City dropdown (8 major cities)
  - Budget slider (max price)
  - Bedroom selection (1-4+)
  - Real-time search with loading state
  - Display of top 3 listings with details

### Task Integration
- **Updated:** `/Users/rachie/gullie-mini/src/data/tasks.ts`
- **Added:** `housing_search` action type to housing tasks
- **Result:** Housing cards now show search form when user asks about apartments

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

1. **User asks about housing/apartments** → Housing service card becomes active
2. **Housing card displays search form** with fields:
   - **City:** Dropdown with major cities (NYC, SF, LA, etc.)
   - **Max Budget:** Number input (e.g., $3000)
   - **Bedrooms:** Dropdown (1-4+ bedrooms)
3. **User clicks "Find Apartments"** → API call to backend
4. **Results appear in card** showing:
   - Top 3 property listings
   - Price, address, bed/bath count
   - Property description
   - Zillow link (if available)

# 🔧 Query Duplicate Location Fix

## ❌ **Problem Identified**

Research queries were showing duplicate location information:

```
"Latest US work visa requirements for France citizens 2025 timeline Week 1 in San Francisco from Paris"
```

The system was adding extra location details even when the customized query already contained location context.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **New Logic: Smart Location Detection**

Added `isLocationAlreadyInQuery()` function that checks if location context is already present by looking for:

1. **Country names** (more reliable for visa queries)
   - "US" in "Latest US work visa requirements..."
   - "France" in "...for France citizens"

2. **City names**
   - "Paris" or "San Francisco" in the query

3. **Visa/Immigration context**
   - Any query containing "visa" or "biometrics" is considered location-aware

### **Updated Query Building Logic**

```javascript
// Before (duplicates)
buildSuggestedQuery() {
  pieces.push(customizedQuery)
  pieces.push(`timeline ${timeframe}`)
  pieces.push(`in ${toCity}`)      // ❌ Always added
  pieces.push(`from ${fromCity}`)  // ❌ Always added
}

// After (smart detection)
buildSuggestedQuery() {
  pieces.push(customizedQuery)

  if (isLocationAlreadyInQuery(customizedQuery, profile)) {
    pieces.push(`timeline ${timeframe}`)  // ✅ Only add timeframe
    return // ✅ Don't add redundant location
  }

  // Only add location if not already present
  pieces.push(`in ${toCity}`)
  pieces.push(`from ${fromCity}`)
}
```

## 📊 **Results Comparison**

### **BEFORE (Duplicates):**
```
"Latest US work visa requirements for France citizens 2025 timeline Week 1 in San Francisco from Paris"
"How to prepare for US visa biometrics appointment in Paris 2025 timeline Week 1 in San Francisco from Paris"
```

### **AFTER (Clean):**
```
"Latest US work visa requirements for France citizens 2025 timeline Week 1"
"How to prepare for US visa biometrics appointment in Paris 2025 timeline Week 1"
```

## 🎯 **Benefits**

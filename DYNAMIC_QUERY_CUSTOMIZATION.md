# 🎯 Dynamic Query Customization - Smart Placeholder System

## ✅ Problem Solved

**BEFORE:** Research placeholders were hardcoded with "Germany" and "Berlin" references, even when users were moving from Paris to San Francisco.

**AFTER:** Placeholders dynamically customize based on the user's actual relocation profile (fromCity → toCity).

## 🔧 Implementation

### Location: `/Users/rachie/gullie-mini/src/components/ResearchActionCard.tsx`

### New Functions Added:

1. **`getCountryFromCity(city)`** - Maps 50+ cities to their countries
2. **`customizeQueryForLocation(query, relocationProfile)`** - Replaces hardcoded locations
3. **`buildSuggestedQuery()` (enhanced)** - Integrates customization into query building

## 📋 Customization Examples

### Scenario: Paris → San Francisco

| **Original Hardcoded Query** | **Customized Query** |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| Current rental market insights for family-friendly neighborhoods in **Berlin** | Current rental market insights for family-friendly neighborhoods in **San Francisco** |
| Latest **Germany** work visa documentation requirements for **US citizens** 2025 | Latest **US** work visa requirements for **France citizens** 2025 |
| How to prepare for **Germany** visa biometrics appointment 2025 | How to prepare for **US** visa biometrics appointment in **Paris** 2025 |
| Best virtual apartment tour tools for **Berlin** relocation 2025 | Best virtual apartment tour tools for **San Francisco** relocation 2025 |

### Scenario: Berlin → New York

| **Original Hardcoded Query** | **Customized Query** |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| Family-friendly neighborhoods in **Berlin** with international schools | Family-friendly neighborhoods in **New York** with international schools |
| Latest **Germany** work visa documentation requirements for **US citizens** 2025 | Latest **US** work visa requirements for **Germany citizens** 2025 |

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Voice Agent Collects Profile** → User mentions "moving from Paris to San Francisco"
2. **Relocation Profile Updated** → `fromCity: "Paris", toCity: "San Francisco"`
3. **Research Cards Appear** → Immigration, housing, etc. tasks become active
4. **Smart Placeholders Generated** → Queries automatically reference correct countries/cities
5. **Relevant Results** → Research returns France visa info, SF housing, etc.

## 🎯 User Experience Impact

### Before Implementation:

- Research placeholder: "Latest Germany work visa documentation requirements..."
- User: *confused - I'm not going to Germany!*

### After Implementation:
- User: "I'm moving from Paris to San Francisco"
- Research placeholder: "Latest US work visa requirements for France citizens..."
- User: *perfect - exactly what I need!*
